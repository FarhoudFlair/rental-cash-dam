# Smith Manoeuvre & Rental Cash Damming Calculator

This calculator simulates the Smith Manoeuvre and Rental Cash Damming strategies for Canadian homeowners with a rental property. It demonstrates potential savings and wealth creation from converting non-deductible mortgage debt into tax-deductible investment debt.

## About the Smith Manoeuvre & Rental Cash Damming

The **Smith Manoeuvre** is a Canadian financial strategy where you convert non-deductible mortgage interest into tax-deductible investment loan interest. As you pay down your mortgage, you reborrow the same amount to invest, creating tax deductions and building investment wealth.

**Rental Cash Damming** is a related strategy for rental property owners. You use a line of credit to pay rental property expenses while using rental income to pay down your non-deductible mortgage faster.

Combined, these strategies can:
- Pay down your primary residence mortgage faster
- Increase monthly cash flow
- Create tax deductions
- Build investment wealth
- Improve overall net worth

## Strategy Options Explained

The calculator includes several checkboxes that let you customize the simulation:

- **Use Rental Cash Damming**: When enabled, rental income is directed to pay down your primary mortgage faster while rental expenses are paid from your HELOC. This creates tax deductions and accelerates mortgage payoff.

- **Use Smith Manoeuvre**: When enabled, equity created from regular mortgage payments is reborrowed via HELOC to invest, creating tax-deductible interest and building investment wealth simultaneously with mortgage repayment.

- **Capitalize HELOC Interest**: When enabled, the interest payments on your HELOC are borrowed from the HELOC itself rather than paid from your cash flow. This improves monthly cash flow but increases the HELOC balance over time.

- **Use Dividends to Pay Mortgage**: When enabled, any dividends generated from your investments are used to make additional payments against your non-deductible mortgage, accelerating the payoff.

- **Use Tax Refunds to Pay Mortgage**: When enabled, the tax refunds generated from deducting HELOC interest are applied to your non-deductible mortgage, further accelerating the payoff.
